# Academic-data
I found this dataset on OSF, and chose it because it had an easy to access codebook and csv file. I chose this column because it seemed like it had quantitative data. From this analysis, I learned that the data is quite symmetrically distributed because the mean and median and close to each other. The deviation seemed to be quite large for the mean.
